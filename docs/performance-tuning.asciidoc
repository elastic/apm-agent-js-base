== Performance Tuning

There are different ways to optimize/tune the performance of the RUM agent. 
Which options to adjust depends on whether you are optimizing for speed, memory
usage, bandwidth or storage.

[[performance-sampling]]
=== Sampling

The first knob to reach for when tuning the performance of the agent is <<transaction-sample-rate,`transactionSampleRate`>>.
Adjusting the sampling rate controls what percent of requests are traced.
By default, the sample rate is set at `1.0`, meaning _all_ requests are traced
and sent to the APM server. 

The sample rate will impact all four performance categories,
so simply turning down the sample rate is an easy way to improve performance.

Here's an example of setting the sample rate to 20%:

[source,js]
----
require('@elastic/apm-rum').init({
  transactionSampleRate: 0.2
})
----

[[performance-breakdown-metrics]]
=== Breakdown Metrics

Breakdown metrics help visualize where your application is spending the majority of
its time. The <<breakdown-metrics,`breakdownMetrics`>> config controls whether metrics
should be calculated for each transaction based on its corresponding type. 

Setting this to `true` will increase the payload/bandwidth usage data to
the APM server.

[[performance-central-config]]
=== APM Agent Configuration 

Activate agent configuration via Kibana to start fetching new configuration
changes from the APM server during the agent initialization phase.

Setting the config option <<central-config,`centralConfig`>> to `true`
incurs the cost of one additional HTTP request when the agent is 
initialized and generates more load to the APM server. It is recommended
to disable this config when the instrumented application is under heavy load.
